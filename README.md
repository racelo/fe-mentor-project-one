## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used Flexbox in this project to make the page responsive but most importantly, to be able to stick the footnote at the bottom of the page. I learned that there are many ways to do this and the most simple one is by setting the margin-top of the footnote to auto. Since I need the main content of my page to be centered, this solution did not work for me. What I did instead was to set the margin of my main content to auto. 

### Continued development

Subjects to focus on:
- CSS box-model
- Relearn the basics of Flexbox
- Learn more about responsive design

### Useful resources
